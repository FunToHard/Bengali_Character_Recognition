# Bengali Character Recognition Project

This project implements a deep learning model for recognizing Bengali characters from images. It includes both command-line and graphical user interfaces for character recognition.

## Project Structure

- `train.py`: Model training script
- `recognize_text.py`: Command-line interface for character recognition
- `bengali_gui.py`: Graphical user interface for character recognition
- `model.py`: Neural network model architecture
- `data_loader.py`: Data loading and preprocessing utilities
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for visualization and evaluation
- `evaluate.py`: Model evaluation script

## Features

- Single character recognition
- Multiple character recognition from images
- Drag-and-drop GUI interface
- Real-time character recognition
- Support for various image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP)
- GPU acceleration support via CUDA
- Character segmentation for text recognition
- Confidence scores for predictions

## Model Performance

- Overall Validation Accuracy: 97.48%
- Supports 62 Bengali characters including:
  - Basic characters (ক, খ, গ, etc.)
  - Numbers (০-৯)
  - Special characters and modifiers

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- PyTorch with CUDA support
- OpenCV
- Tkinter
- PIL (Pillow)
- NumPy
- See requirements.txt for complete list
